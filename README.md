# Face-Detection# Face Detection and Verification System

This project focuses on real-time face detection and verification using classical computer vision techniques and supervised learning methods. It aims to identify and verify facial regions in images and videos, as well as assess content authenticity—including potential deepfakes—through pixel-level analysis and feature extraction.

## 🔍 Overview

- Built with **OpenCV**, **dlib**, and **Haar Cascades**
- Designed for robust facial region detection in diverse visual conditions
- Implements supervised learning models to classify content authenticity
- Evaluates performance using pixel-wise comparison across facial features
- Research and evaluation currently in progress for academic publication

## 🧠 Core Features

- Real-time face detection in static images and video streams
- Verification and classification of facial content authenticity
- Experimentation with multiple feature extraction and classification techniques
- Pixel-level analysis for evaluating deepfake likelihood

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, C++
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, dlib, NumPy, scikit-learn
- **Tools:** Jupyter, VSCode, Git
